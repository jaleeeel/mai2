        You are my heart and my soul my inspiration
        Just like the old love song goes
        You are one of the few things worth remembering
        And since it's all true
        How could anyone mean more to me than youYou are the one who makes me happy
        When everything else turns to grey
        Yours is the voice that wakes me mornings
        And sends me out into the day
        You are the crowd that sits quiet
        Listening to me
        And all the mad sense that I make
        You are one of the few things worth remembering
        And since it's all true
        How could anyone mean more to me than you
        Sorry if sometimes I look past you
        There's no one beyond your eyes
        Inside my head wheels are turning
        Hey, sometimes I'm not so wise
        You are my heart and my soul my inspiration
        Just like the old love song goes
        You are one of the few things worth remembering
        And since it's all trueYou are the one who makes me happy
